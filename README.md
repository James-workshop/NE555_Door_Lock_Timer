# NE555_Door_Lock_Timer
NE555 timer was launched in 1971 and has a history of 50 years. It is easy to use, stable and cheap, so it is still widely used, and its output in 2003 was 1 billion. Now I use NE555 to make timers. Most of the control parts of electronic door locks use this circuit. The timing method is very simple, 1.1 x RC, which is not very accurate compared with MCU, but it is very simple
